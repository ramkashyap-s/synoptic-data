Data is generated using datarequest.py. It makes requests for 2017 year and stores it in the data.csv file. 

Line chart represent maximum, minimum and median temperatures over the year.

Using the brush element, temperatures in a specific range of time period can be viewed.

We can see that the temperatures are high in the months from June to September. Highest temperature seems to be in the month of July and lowest temperature in January

## Scope for improvements
* Send a request to update the data every day and update charts accordingly
* Collect historic data for temperature over months for past 20 years and visualize them.
* Refactor the code
